## Load the data
```{r}
setwd("/Users/xiaochangmiao/GitHub/ML-Course/Statistical Learning/Regression")
data = read.csv("Advertising.csv")
data = data[, 2:5]
```

## Model with ONLY main effects
```{r cars}
lr = lm(formula = "sales ~. ", data = data)
summary(lr)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow= c(2,2))
plot(lr)
```
The residual plot shows a clear U-shape, suggesting a non-linearity effect.

```{r}
hist(lr$residuals, breaks = 20, xlab = "Residuals", main = "Histogram of Residuals")
```

## Model with interaction term

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
lr = lm(formula = "sales ~ TV + radio + TV : radio", data = data)
summary(lr)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(lr)
```
Including the interaction term clearly improves the predictive power.

```{r}
hist(lr$residuals, breaks = 20, xlab = "Residuals", main = "Histogram of Residuals")
```
